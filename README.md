# DooD Encryption Library

Welcome to the **DooD Encryption Library**, a personal passion project aimed at implementing a secure encryption library for the messaging app **DooD**. This library is based on the **Signal Protocol**, renowned for its robust security features and end-to-end encryption.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to ensure that messages sent through **DooD** are private and secure, protecting users' communication from unauthorized access. By leveraging the Signal Protocol, the library provides the foundation for secure messaging, including features like:

- End-to-end encryption for messages.
- Key management and secure key exchange.
- Forward secrecy and message confidentiality.

Please note that while this library is inspired by the Signal Protocol, it is a **personal project** and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Signal.

## Documentation

⚠️ **Note**: This project is currently under development and is not yet stable. As a result, comprehensive documentation is not available at this time.

Once the project reaches a stable state, detailed documentation, including usage examples, API references, and guidelines, will be added to help developers integrate and use the library effectively.

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Important**: I am not an expert in cryptography, and this library is a learning project. While every effort has been made to follow the principles of the Signal Protocol, there may be vulnerabilities or flaws in the implementation.

**Use this library at your own risk.** It is not recommended for production environments or applications requiring guaranteed security.

## Final Note

This library is a work in progress and is provided as-is. Security is a complex field, and cryptographic implementations require rigorous testing and expertise. If you are building a production application, consider using established, audited libraries like [libsignal](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal).

Thank you for checking out the **DooD Encryption Library**! If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
